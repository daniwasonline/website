# danny.works - the reference implementation for the Aegix HIG system

This Git repository contains [Hydro](https://danny.works)'s website (version 11), written in Next.js and styled with Tailwind. This site is also a reference implementation for **Aegix**, a simplistic human interface guideline (HIG) design system/language.

### How can I run this site in development?
This site uses the default Next.js CLI scripts. Simply run `yarn install` or `npm i` in order to install the dependencies necessary for the site, then run `yarn dev` or `yarn start` to launch a development server.

To run the site in production, run `yarn build` to compile, then use `yarn prod` to launch a production-ready webserver.

### What is Aegix?
As stated above, Aegix is a HIG (user interface) design language that aims to be simple without sacrificing usability or function. It is highly inspired by many other examples of UI systems (most notably Next.js/Vercel and standard Tailwind design language).
