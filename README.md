# danny.works (daniwasonline), v12
Time for the yearly refresh of this website! This repository is a monorepo for all related projects related to this website. At the moment, it's just the frontend, but I may choose to open-source Anemo (the backend API for v11 and v12) in the future.

## Retrospective
This is probably the best iteration thus far, and I'm very much proud of how it turned out! Like v11, this site is built with Next.js and Tailwind, but is a lot more efficient in the backend given that it now utilises server-side fetches in App Directory. Not everything is here, obviously, but what I've got I'm very happy with!

I should play with animations down the line, if I remember :p


## Credit
Credit should be given where it's due:

- Inspiration: [axyria.dev](https://axyria.dev/), I found their website super cool and essentially used their website as sort of a reference for v12. Kudos!
- Icons: [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), I used their icons throughout the site for pretty much every icon.
- Everyone else who helped critique the site and gave me feedback, thank you! :D
